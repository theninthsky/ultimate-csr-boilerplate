<h1 align="center">Ultimate CSR Boilerplate</h1>

This project implements the optimizations that were demonstrated in my [case study](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering).

Fully abiding by this boilerplate's requirements grants you the following:

- [Extreme vendors splitting for better cache persistence](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#caching)
- [Code-splitting](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#code-splitting)
- [Preloading of all current page scripts](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#preloading-async-pages)
- [Prefetching of all scripts for instant navigations](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#prefetching-async-pages)
- [Preloading of data](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#preloading-data)
- [Prerendering for perfect SEO](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#prerendering)
